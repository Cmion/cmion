### Hey I'm [@cmion](https://github.com/cmion) (Simeon Akpanudo) 👋


I'm a software developer from Lagos, Nigeria 🇳🇬

I've been building apps both on mobile and on the web, using technologies like React, NextJS, TypeScript/JavaScript, NodeJS, expressJS, NestJS, MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, AWS, GCP, Dart & Flutter. I also dabble with Rust, and Python to build APIs thingy.

I love listening to people, users, customers whatever you want to call them, I build from their perspective. Brainstorming, trying out new things, and building new amazing products gives me shivers 🥶, **I LOVE IT ❤️**
